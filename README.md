# 54m-OS

### Requirements

Requires qemu to be installed:

On mac:
```
brew install qemu
```

### To build

./tools/scripts/compile.sh

### To run

./tools/scripts/qemu_run.sh

This will launch a qemu window on your desktop (possibly silently so you'll have to go find it). Qemu will run a x86 emulator launched with BIOS.
